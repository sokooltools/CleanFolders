# CleanFolders
Opens an MS Windows mini-application for providing a quick and easy-to-use mechanism for 
deleting extraneous files and/or folders from within a given <b>Visual Studio</b> 
`solution` folder.

This application is not limited to just <b>Visual Studio</b> `solution` specific files 
and folders, i.e., it can also be used to delete other files and folders of a particular 
name or extension.

This shows a typical window that is displayed after right-clicking a solution folder 
(the 'CleanFolders' solution in this example) in MS Windows Explorer, then selecting the 
**Clean Folder...** context menu item:

Notice the items in the tree view shown in red and already checkmarked
correspond to the 'Folder Names' and 'File Extensions' containing checkmarks inside 
the 'Auto-Select' group box.

### Options

A folder can be dragged directly onto this application or opened from within the 
application itself by clicking the 'folder' icon button located adjacent to the folder path.

An optional <i>context menu item</i> is available for quickly launching 
this application when right-clicking a selected folder in 'MS Windows Explorer'.

Currently this context menu item is made available by double-clicking (in Window's Explorer), 
the "CleanFolders.reg" file included in this solution folder.
