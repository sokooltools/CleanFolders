# CleanFolders
Opens a mini-application for providing a quick and easy-to-use mechanism for deleting extraneous <b>Visual Studio</b> files and/or folders from within a given folder.

This application is not limited to <b>Visual Studio</b> specific files, i.e., it can also be used to delete other files and/or folders of a particular name or extension.

### Options

Any folder can be dragged directly onto this application or opened from within the application itself by clicking the 'folder' button located adjacent to the folder path.

An optional right-click 'Windows Explorer' <i>context menu</i> is also available for quickly launching this application using the selected folder.
